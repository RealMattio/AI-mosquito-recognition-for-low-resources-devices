# AI-mosquito-recognition-for-low-resources-devices

This project has the purpose of comparing some Deep and Machine Learning models to identify mosquitos from other insects.
This project will only compare models that work with low resources, so that they can be deployed on portable devices, such as Raspberry, for mosquito identification and monitoring in resource-limited locations.

### Image dataset
To train the models covered in this project was used the dataset downloadable at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hammaadali/insects-recognition?resource=download).
The original dataset provide 5 diffrent class of insects: butterfly, dragonfly, grasshopper, ladybird, mosquitos. In this project the aim is to classify mosquitos so the other classes was unified in one class called non_mosquitos.
